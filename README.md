# MicrosoftWinFormsDesignerSDK_Test1

Trying to figure out VS2022 design-time support for a custom NET6 WinForms control.

See \Pack\packNotes.txt for how I build the package.
See \Pack\package for example packages I made.

The MyButtonLibrary.Design project uses Nuget package microsoft.winforms.designer.sdk (1.1.0-prerelease-preview3.22076.5) to add design-time support to the MyButtonLibrary.MyButton control.
